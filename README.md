# Experimental Verification and Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to compare eleven different sorting algorithms through experimentation to determine their efficiency and suitability for various applications. We experimented with our program to obtain data for analysis in our report and created a GUI to visualize the different sorting algorithms. This comprehensive approach allowed us to both study and demonstrate the performance characteristics of each algorithm in a user-friendly manner.

## Introduction

Sorting algorithms have been developed to handle different data structures, sizes, and performance requirements. Each algorithm has unique characteristics, making it suitable for specific applications. Our project compares these algorithms by evaluating their performance on several metrics, including the number of comparisons, swaps, and execution time. We use graphical representations to illustrate the results and draw conclusions about each algorithm's efficiency for different data sizes.

## Methodology

We compare various sorting algorithms by generating test cases with varying input sizes (1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7000, 10000) using randomized lists of numbers. The main metric measured is the number of comparisons, reflecting the algorithm's efficiency. We implement the sorting algorithms using classes and relationships, with a base class containing common methods and attributes. Derived classes override the base class's virtual function to implement specific sorting algorithms.

### Implementation Details

- **Base Class**: Contains common methods and attributes for all sorting algorithms.
- **Derived Classes**: Implement specific sorting algorithms, each with unique functions where necessary.
- **Main Function**: Declares array size, prints unsorted and sorted arrays to files, and outputs the number of comparisons.

## Specification of Algorithms Used

We analyze eleven sorting algorithms, discussing their efficiency and limitations. The algorithms are compared both theoretically and practically to determine their suitability for various industries and applications.
